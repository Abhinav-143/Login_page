# Login Page (React.js)

This is a simple, client-side login page built using React.js and styled with CSS. The page allows users to enter their credentials for authentication and provides a clean, responsive interface.

# Key Features:
# React.js Framework:

Utilizes React.js components to handle user input, state management, and form submission.
Efficient and scalable for small to mid-size applications where client-side authentication is sufficient.

# Simple Form Validation:

Basic validation is applied to ensure the user provides both a username/email and a password before submission.
Validation is handled locally within the React component, without server-side or database integration.

# CSS Styling:

Custom CSS is applied to style the login page, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
The layout is responsive, making the page functional on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
# Client-Side Authentication:

User input (username and password) is checked against a predefined set of valid credentials directly in the React component.
If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and redirected (or shown a success message).
No database or backend is used in this version, making it ideal for demonstrations or front-end focused projects.

# User Feedback:

Displays error messages if invalid credentials are entered.
Shows a success message or performs an action (like redirecting) on successful login.
